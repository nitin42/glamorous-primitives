## Problem
You cannot use [glamorous](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous) together with [react-primitives](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/react-primitives) to style the components.

## Solution
Combine glamorous with react-primitives by removing implicit dependencies to render the same code across the targets.

> Use this package **only** when you want to share the same code across multiple platforms. If you're looking to style the components for a specific platform use [glamorous-native](https://github.com/robinpowered/glamorous-native) for React Native or [glamorous](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous) for React

## Install

```
npm install glamorous-primitives --save
```

This also depends on `react` and `react-primitives`. Make sure you have them installed.

## Examples

You can find all the examples [here](./examples).

## Documentation

There are no breaking changes in `glamorous-primitives` except for [one thing](#caveats) which means you can do everything you used to do with `glamorous` and `glamorous-native` üòÑ

## What's more ?
I am working on üëáüèº

- [ ] className as prop using babel transform 
- [ ] css prop (like glamorous)

## Caveats
`glamorous-primitives` does not export the "tiny" version of glamorous like glamorous and glamorous-native.
